# ui

> [!WARNING]
> It is not recommended to build the plugin and/or UI manually, as pre-built releases are provided via each [Releases' Assets](https://github.com/fivenet-app/plugins/releases).

## Building

**It is important to use the `generate` task and not the `build` task!**

```console
yarn run generate
```
